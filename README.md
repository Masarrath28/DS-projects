PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project implements a real-time emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system processes video input from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies the detected facial expressions into predefined emotion categories. The result is displayed in real-time on the video feed with bounding boxes and labels.

Prerequisites
